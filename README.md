***BombSquad: Overclocked!*** Taking what vanilla does best and **THROWING IT ALL OUT THE WINDOW**. No but seriously what are this modpack's goals?
- Showing my ideas: BombSquad isn't perfect but has been one of the only games that I have easily been able to make my ideas come to life in, so I want to create a modpack that shows the chaos in my mind without ruining the gameplay, and I want this modpack to be a thank you to BombSquad and the community surrounding it for always bringing joy to me since childhood.
- Fixing previous mistakes: There have been a lot of modpacks (and mods) in the past, but some if not most of them either messed up at places or missed a lot of potential (*cough* bombdash *cough*). This modpack tries to bring back parts of these mods and fix these mistakes or make them reach their max potential.
- Bringing back memories: While bringing new content to the table, this modpack also tries to bring back a lot of classic mods and show them mixed with the new content; familiar games on a different level of chaos makes a new experience.
